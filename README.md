# üì© SMS Spam Detection Using Scikit-Learn

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.  
It uses Python's **Scikit-learn** library with **NLP techniques** for text processing, feature extraction, and model training.

## üß† Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK  
- **Tools:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Algorithm:** Multinomial Naive Bayes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removing special characters, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.  
2. **Feature Extraction:** Converting text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
3. **Model Training:** Using **Naive Bayes Classifier** for text classification.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
